# Project-Two

## Marc:

### I've added the dotenv package

To get the DB working on your machine, create a file called ".env" in the root directory.

Inside it, put in your local DB credentials like so:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
NODE_ENV=development
```

TO-DOs

-   Decrement wine inventory
-   Wine Details Page
-

## Victor:

### Here is a list of to do items I thought of. I might make a site-map that shows all the interconnections.

### To-Do (some are for sure optional):

#### Add pathing to dropdown menu;

#### Link notes body to notes div and make them show up when focused on each wine;

#### Add functionality to buttons in listed wines;

      -Edit details
      -Delete

#### Change ageability to ageability-index on page;

#### Add expiry date to form and wine list;

#### Make pages and routes || present the entirety of the data on each wine to the notes Div, rather than creating and linking to another page for each wine;

#### Add sort-by function to wines list and/or a search bar;

#### Delete routes used for testing, i.e. all-notes, all-wines, all-users, or add link to them and require admin password;

#### Add about us page with links to our github, linked-in, short bio, w/e;

#### Get server up and running at my house and make sure it works with app;

#### Draft final copy of README.md

#### Design presentation;

#### Site content & copy

#### Display "Your Collection" accurately with details
